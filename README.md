* The RozeShowCaseTitleColumnRow.html is working with margins & you can see all my artwork. 
* I have not hosted it, freely as of yet. 
* Will incorporate more borders, more description in the body & try to include some javascript functions. 
* Then wrap it up with a pretty jQuery feature.
* //I cannot upload an entire folder file through this Chromebook only the individual files.
* Just added 2 buttons & 1 image-class-button for my LinkedIn, the twitter account & my Github Profile.
* Centered the titles of the illustrations & gave the buttons borders & sizes.
* Spaced out the images better.
