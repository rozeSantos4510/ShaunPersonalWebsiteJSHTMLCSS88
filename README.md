# Creating my own website to host with 
# CSS & Javascript functions in a custom HTML
here you will find location. GEO location, that is now. Here && now in Barack Obama's court of law && in real understood reality right here.
* The RozeShowCaseTitleColumnRow.html is working with margins & you can see all my artwork. 
* I have not hosted it, freely as of yet. 
* Will incorporate more borders, more description in the body & try to include some javascript functions. 
* Then wrap it up with a pretty jQuery feature.
* //I cannot upload an entire folder file through this Chromebook only the individual files.
* Just added 2 buttons & 1 image-class-button for my LinkedIn, the twitter account & my Github Profile.
* Centered the titles of the illustrations & gave the buttons borders & sizes.
* Spaced out the images better.
* Reordering of images & better margins & more br's
* The images are being selected from the folder they are in now.
* Now the first 3 images if you click one of them go to new webpages with a bigger sole image.
* Now the illustrations fit correctly in the next html page. Then just click the browswer back button.
* Completed html pages for the top six images. So if a user clicks the image they can enlarge.
* Now images 1-9 can be enlargedski's & you can go backski's
* Now images 1-12 have there own webpage & you can then go back.
* images 1-15 can now be enlarged.
* All images have their own webpage if you click them && now you can clearly see them bigger. Full screen.
* Now I have an embedded Twitter widget. That updates automatically from the Twitter account, @IntPresident.
* [Javascript API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/javascript-api/overview), I would of like to have learned that manually with javascript but Twitter does the work for you.
* Excellent, 2/28/22
* Thats a nice little footer.
* now the footer Rescales to every ScreenSize && Device.
* The Recscalin' Footer is filled in with Gray to match, the headers are all White && the body is now grey style="background-color:#808080;"
* Row && Column have margin-right && margin-left now are both 0.0 no padding is necessary.
* Different data-widget-id for twitter feed.
* Now you got a weather js.widget in the bottom there.
* This weatherwidget-io <weatherwidget-io> is displaying in Fahrenheit from this websites javascript [Forcast 7](https://forecast7.com/en/41d88n87d63/chicago/?unit=us)
* I need to purchase an API to be able to use Accuweather to build javascript functions to communicate with its API
* Now the buttons open up their webpages into a new tab with the "_blank" command.
* Now all of the column images have the same border color as the color of the buttons, strawberry. Then the font inside is a banana yellow.
* The button borders are now the hex color #000000 which is solid black.
* I could only make the weather widget get a strawberry border. The twitter widget is not accepting a border perhaps because u can scroll.
* Now if you click one of the pieces && you are brought to the next page with it in full screen it has the 
#ffe347 banana yellow background color.
* The two buttons I have on either side of the Twitter fa-fa button are the font-family Agency FB, Impact, monospace &&
  the titles of each piece of Artwork are now part of the w3 school example font-family Lucida Console, Courier New, monospace.
* DOM stands for Document Object Model. Very similar to a HUD you see in a video game. Or the Heads Up Display a pilot uses to see information.
* Updated one of the borders to the hex color, #98FB98, otherwise known as the Moschino Drama, Big Hair, Big Scoop.
* The DHTML Test Example.
* For a client to server. All you need is a server where you have access. Then from there.
  You build the client to communicate with it && that is where all your fixed && resting information
  is now stored so you can use it with the client which is what you see. 
  The client is the webpage. The server is a data server && handles your traffic && a list of other things for you
  the person buying && using the server for your client to host on the world wide web.
