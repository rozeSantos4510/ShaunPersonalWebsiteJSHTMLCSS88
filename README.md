here you will find location. GEO location, that is now. Here && now in Barack Obama's court of law && in real understood reality right here.
* The RozeShowCaseTitleColumnRow.html is working with margins & you can see all my artwork. 
* I have not hosted it, freely as of yet. 
* Will incorporate more borders, more description in the body & try to include some javascript functions. 
* Then wrap it up with a pretty jQuery feature.
* //I cannot upload an entire folder file through this Chromebook only the individual files.
* Just added 2 buttons & 1 image-class-button for my LinkedIn, the twitter account & my Github Profile.
* Centered the titles of the illustrations & gave the buttons borders & sizes.
* Spaced out the images better.
* Reordering of images & better margins & more br's
* The images are being selected from the folder they are in now.
* Now the first 3 images if you click one of them go to new webpages with a bigger sole image.
* Now the illustrations fit correctly in the next html page. Then just click the browswer back button.
* Completed html pages for the top six images. So if a user clicks the image they can enlarge.
* Now images 1-9 can be enlargedski's & you can go backski's
* Now images 1-12 have there own webpage & you can then go back.
* images 1-15 can now be enlarged.
* All images have their own webpage if you click them && now you can clearly see them bigger. Full screen.
* Now I have an embedded Twitter widget. That updates automatically from the Twitter account, @IntPresident.
* [Javascript API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/javascript-api/overview), I would of like to have learned that manually with javascript but Twitter does the work for you.
* Excellent, 2/28/22

* The Recscalin' Footer is filled in with Gray to match, the headers are all White && the body is now grey style="background-color:#808080;"
* Row && Column have margin-right && margin-left now are both 0.0 no padding is necessary.
