here you will find location. GEO location, that is now. Here && now in Barack Obama's court of law && in real understood reality right here.
* The RozeShowCaseTitleColumnRow.html is working with margins & you can see all my artwork. 
* I have not hosted it, freely as of yet. 
* Will incorporate more borders, more description in the body & try to include some javascript functions. 
* Then wrap it up with a pretty jQuery feature.
* //I cannot upload an entire folder file through this Chromebook only the individual files.
* Just added 2 buttons & 1 image-class-button for my LinkedIn, the twitter account & my Github Profile.
* Centered the titles of the illustrations & gave the buttons borders & sizes.
* Spaced out the images better.
* Reordering of images & better margins & more br's
* The images are being selected from the folder they are in now.
* Now the first 3 images if you click one of them go to new webpages with a bigger sole image.
* Now the illustrations fit correctly in the next html page. Then just click the browswer back button.
* Completed html pages for the top six images. So if a user clicks the image they can enlarge.
